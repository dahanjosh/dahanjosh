- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dahanjosh
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a real estate developer interested in learning computer science and programming to dive deeper into tech.
- I want to leverage coding in my job and make my job more efficient, while also staying on top of technology, a passion of mine since I was young. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript trying to build up some personal projects for fun. LMK if you'd like to work on something together!
